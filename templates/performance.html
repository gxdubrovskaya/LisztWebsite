        <p>There are few, if any, good sources that give an impression of how Liszt really sounded from the 1820s. Carl
          Czerny claimed Liszt was a natural who played according to feeling, and reviews of his concerts especially
          praise the brilliance, strength and precision in his playing. At least one also mentions his ability to keep
          absolute tempo, which may be due to his father's insistence that he practice with a metronome. His repertoire
          at this time consisted primarily of pieces in the style of the brilliant Viennese school, such as concertos by
          Hummel and works by his former teacher Czerny, and his concerts often included a chance for the boy to display
          his prowess in improvisation. Liszt possessed notable sight-reading skills.</p>

          <p>"M. Liszt's playing contains abandonment, a liberated feeling, but even when it becomes impetuous and
            energetic in
            his fortissimo, it is still without harshness and dryness. [...] [He] draws from the piano tones that are
            purer,
            mellower and stronger than anyone has been able to do; his touch has an indescribable charm. [...] He is the
            enemy

            makes a
